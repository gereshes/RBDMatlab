# RBDMatlab
This toolbox is a repository for assorted functions related to rigid body dynamics from many different projects. All are written in MatLab.
I plan on adding to this repository sporadically as I work on other projects. Do not expect there to be active work on the functions in this toolbox. If you find an error in a function let me know and I'll try to fix it.
